Controls redirects from the WordPress block editor and filters access to the block editor based on user role.

== Description ==

The plugin vs-redirect preforms two tasks:

1. When the user clicks on the WordPress icon while in the block editor, redirect them to the custom post management page.
2. Prevents users who do not have access to certain post types from accessing said post type. (ex. non-Real-Estate and Card Only users)

When a user tries to access something they shouldn't, send them to their company page.

"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
